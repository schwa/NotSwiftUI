# NotSwiftUI


Based on code from Objc.io's series of Swift talks about SwiftUI state.
Goal is modernise the code and make it more "production" ready and less tutorial code. Portions of the code are copyright Objc.io and portions are copyright Jonathan Wight. The license is still the original MIT license.
